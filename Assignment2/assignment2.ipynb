    "## Building a Local Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's programming assignment, you will be working on a small-scale local Google Maps. Throughout the assignment, you will step by step build this route planner. You do not need to copy the code, it is enough to work in the cell under each assignment. Note that there are separate cells provided where you can (and should) test your code. During the assignment, you will (through customMagics) obtain a Python file (.py) which you should run against a set of unittests. Please avoid writing any unnecessary code in cells containing the `%%execwritefile` command. Doing this could alter the file `.py` and make it syntactically incorrect or interfere with the unittests. To prevent this stick to the following rules:\n",
    " - ***Do not remove cells that start with ``%%execwritefile`` and do not remove that line.***\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and a class definition you need to complete the given methods and adding helper methods is allowed, but do **not** add new functions or Python script to the cells (like global variables).\n",
    " - If a cell contains a `%%execwritefile` command at the top and **not** a class definition you must complete the given functions and you are free to add helper functions, new classes, and Python script that contains for example global variables. Note, that the use of global variables is almost always wrong except for a few use cases such as RNG for the numpy random generator methods.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command you can plot things, print variables, and write test cases. Here, you are free to do whatever you want.\n",
    " - If a cell does **not** contain a `%%execwritefile` command it should not contain functional code that is needed to run other functions or classes. The reason is that it is not copied to the `.py`. So, it can not be used during the unittesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to look at the customMagic.py nor do more than glimpse at the test file, your assignment is contained in this workbook unless specified differently in this notebook's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is given as a Jupyter notebook, you might run this in your browser by starting a notebook server or through VScode (PyCharm only allows for read-only mode for jupyter notebooks, unless you have Pycharm-pro which is a paid version or you need a student license). The simplest way to [install jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/), a custom python distribution and packagemanager used for Data Science. If you do not want to install all of Anaconda you can also install jupyter via pip: ``pip3 install jupyter`` (`pip3` or `pip` will work depending on how you installed python3). You can find a tutorial for running the notebook [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html). With VScode the IDE should guide you in installing the correct packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint: Jupyter Notebooks saves variables between runs. If you get unexpected results try restarting the kernel, this deletes any saved variables.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Additional Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You are not allowed to change the given code. This includes attribute names, method names, arguments, etc.\n",
    " - You are not allowed to import other modules than the one provided.\n",
    " - You are allowed to add functions yourself if you feel that that makes it easier. Note, however, that points are deducted if we think that they are unnecessary. Make sure to document these consistently.\n",
    " - Read the written documentation about the functions you need to implement, they tell you what to do. Most of these functions require less than 10 lines of code.\n",
    " - In the end, you can run unittests as an extra check that your code works. You are free to add additional unittests.\n",
    " - If your program does not succeed on all unittests that are provided, it is likely that there is still a problem in your code. Make sure that all unittests succeed, before submitting the code.\n",
    " - Also keep in mind that all unit tests should be able to run within a matter of seconds on any computer.\n",
    " - A path always consists of the source and destination node/coordinate.\n",
    " - Also, a path describes unambiguous how to go from the source to the destination. For an algorithm that uses the grid to find the path, you will give all coordinates that are visited. An algorithm that uses nodes, you give all the nodes that are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Throughout the assignment, questions are asked about various algorithms and how and why they work. The answers are typical things that should be found in your report. \n",

    "## Assignment Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will create a route planner for a fictional country where we have several cities connected by highways. Your final goal is to give travel directions (route description) to go as fast as possible from any coordinate in the map to any other coordinate in the map. Due to the size of the map, it would be infeasible to use an exhaustive search, where you check all possible paths and find the fastest path. Therefore, we will use the idea of dynamic programming to save partial solutions that are always the same (between crossroads you travel always at the same coordinates), and the idea of divide and conquer to find the fastest path at several levels of abstraction (neighborhood, city, and country). Lastly, we will use Dijkstra (a form of dynamic programming) to find the fastest path efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, we will start small with simpler algorithms and slowly build towards this more complex algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest Path (distance):\n",
    " - [1.0](#1.0-Grid-Floodfill,-a-Basic-BFS) Breadth-first search (BFS) with a small and simple grid, i.e., flood-fill algorithm.\n",
    " - [1.1](#1.1-Graph-vs-Grid) Building a graph from an array to reduce the size of the state-space.\n",
    " - [1.2](#1.2-Graph-Floodfill) BFS using a weighted graph based on the array.\n",
    " - [1.3](#1.3-BFS-with-Priority-Queue) BFS using a weighted graph and a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fastest Path (time):\n",
    " - [2.0](#2.0-Fastest-Path-with-BFS) Make a more general BFS algorithm where you take the maximum speed into account.\n",
    " - [2.1](#2.1-From-Coordinate-to-Node) Make an algorithm to find the nearest nodes given the grid and graph.\n",
    " - [2.2](#2.2-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations) Split the graph into multiple graphs to reduce the state-space (A manual optimization based on divide and conquer). Now, we can chain several optimal paths to find a coordinate to coordinate path.\n",
    " - [2.3](#2.3a-Solving-the-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations) In the previous step, we cut the graphs into several graphs. However, this might not always lead to the optimal path, therefore, We can at a parameter for how many solutions you want to find for each separate graph. This gives us the opportunity to tune between optimization and optimal pathfinding.\n",
    " - [3.0](#3.0-Fastest-Path-Between-Coordinates-(map-level-5)) Put everything together to find the (almost) optimal path from one coordinate to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note, that if you only explain in the report the steps splitting of the graphs and multiple solutions without programming it, you still are able to get an 8.5***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `grid_maker` module you can find a class `Map` that can be initialized with several difficulty levels, below you can find a description of each difficulty level. \n",
    "- level 0: A small grid representing a neighborhood with roads around the edges and streets from edge to edge.\n",
    "- level 1: A small grid representing a neighborhood with roads around the edges but the streets are not necessary from edge to edge.\n",
    "- level 2: A medium grid representing a larger neighborhood consisting of 4 level 1 neighborhoods with main roads around the edges.\n",
    "- level 3: A large grid representing a city district that consists of 4 larger neighborhoods with main roads around the edges and between the larger neighborhoods.\n",
    "- level 4: A very large grid representing a city that has 4 city districts and main roads between city districts and around the city.\n",
    "- level 5: A huge grid representing a country, consisting of 2 to 5 cities. Each city has a ring highway with exits leading into the city. The ring highways are interconnected with highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Objects Methods & Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of road has its own speed limit which can be adjusted in `grid_maker.py` and denoted by an integer in the grid. Therefore, the values in a grid can also be used to identify road types. Furthermore, the `Map` class also contains several useful methods to help you program (You can ignore all static methods):\n",
    " - The `repr` method can be used to print the grid.\n",
    " - The `show` method can be used to plot the grid as an image. If a path is given as an argument for show then the path is also shown. A path should consist of a list of coordinates (a tuple of two ints). The second argument `axis` is a boolean which determines if the axis are plotted or not.\n",
    " - A `Map` object can be indexed the same way a 2D numpy array can be indexed. For example, `Map()[0,0]` gives the top left coordinate of a `Map`.\n",
    " - The `get_coordinate`  method gets a random coordinate on the map.\n",
    " - The `get_coordinate_in_city` method gets a random coordinate in a specific city and defaults to `get_coordinate` if the difficulty level is lower than 5.\n",
    " - The `get_city_map` method returns a copy of the map without the highways, but with exits.\n",
    " - The `get_highway_map` method returns a copy of the map with only highways.\n",
    " - The `get_all_city_exits` method return all highway exits of all cities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "A `Map` object has also the following attributes:\n",
    " - `grid`, the map which is a 2D numpy array.\n",
    " - `shape`, the shape of the grid.\n",
    " - `size`, the size of the grid.\n",
    " - `city_corners`, the upper left corner of a city in the general map, for level 0 to 4 this is just `(0,0)`\n",
    " - `city_grids`, the individual city grids of each map. Note, that this has a different coordinate system than the `map`. Namely, Each individual city has a left upper corner (0,0). So a coordinate in a individual city corresponds to a coordinate in the map using the `city_corners`."

    "## 1.0 Grid Floodfill, a Basic BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 4 exercise 3, we have seen how you can find the shortest path with breadth-first search (BFS) with static source and destination nodes. In this assignment, we will implement a more general algorithm where we can find any destination node in a grid from any source node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often BFS on a grid is called a flood-fill algorithm. So, if you want more information about these kinds of BFS algorithms you can google flood-fill algorithms. The idea of a flood-fill algorithm is that you take one step in all possible directions in the grid. In this assignment, we can only go up, down, left, and right. For example, if you look at the image down below the red arrows indicate the first \"layer\" in the flood-fill algorithm. Next, you take one step from the red arrows that are indicated by the blue arrows. So, a flood-fill algorithm is just a BFS algorithm on a graph with cycles that is often structured as a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we can implement a BFS on the grid, we need to think about how to solve one of the major problems in graph traversal with cyclic graphs which is how to prevent going in circles. The simplest solution is to have a variable (history) that tracks where you have been. If you come across a node/coordinate that you have already visited then you would run in cycle if you keep exploring so you do not explore any option that you can take from that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab 4 exercise 3, we stored all the paths how to get to a node. In this assignment, we do not need to store all paths as we are only interested in the optimal path therefore for each node only the previous node in the grid is stored. This is what the arrows in the image indicate. This makes it possible to retrace the steps and find the full path. As usual, you start the flood-fill at the source node. However, we can stop as soon as we find the destination node. Think about why we can stop if we find the destination node. Is it possible to find a shorter path after you already found the destination node? Why does Floodfill guarantee that you find the shortest path?\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the following grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "road_grid = np.array([\n",
    "    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n",
    "    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A flood-fill from node `(4,2)` to `(6,5)` would look like the image below. Note, that the arrows are the information stored at each node (no arrow is no information) and the colors are one step in the flood-fill. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"floodfill.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint: Throughout the assignment, we will use attributes like queue and history. The difference between the two is that a queue determines the order in which nodes are visited. So everything in the queue has not been visited yet. The history does *not* tell which nodes are already visited, but which ones are visited or in the priority queue. In other words, the history contains all the steps that are taken or which will be taken. Also, it stores, for each node, information on how you can reach the node optimally, i.e., the previous node in the optimal path and (depending on the exercise) the distance between these nodes.**"

    "## 1.1 Graph vs Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "While the pathfinding works in the previous question it is not very efficient for a large grid or road network. Therefore, we can apply the principles of divide and conquer and dynamic programming to make it faster. So instead of finding the next possible action for each coordinate each time we run the solver, we will make a graph representation of the road network where we can save all possible next action for the coordinates that matter. When this graph is made we can use it to find the shortest path. Think about how this affects the algorithm and why it becomes faster. Does the complexity change or the state-space?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.0 Making Graph Nodes from a Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will make the graph from a given city grid. This graph should contain the following nodes:\n",
    " - All coordinates that are junctions.\n",
    " - All coordinates where you can change direction.\n",
    " - All coordinates that are a dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other coordinates should ***not*** be in the graph. To represent the graph we use an adjacency list where each node in the graph is a coordinate. \n",

So, a piece of road between two nodes, i.e, the edge between two nodes has a distance equal to the number of coordinates between the nodes and the speed limit is the mode of all the speed limits of the coordinates.

    "## 1.3 BFS with Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "As you discovered in the previous task, a basic floodfill or BFS does not work on a more general graph compared to a grid. Here, we will update the algorithm such that it works in the more general case. There are many names for such an algorithm. However, in this assignment, we are only interested in why and how it works. The main problem of a simple BFS is that it does not take into account the cost of going from one node to the next. In [1.0 Grid Floodfill ](#1.0-Grid-Floodfill,-a-Basic-BFS) this was not a problem as the cost was 1 for all steps. However, in a graph, the cost between two neighboring nodes can be anything because it is the distance between the two nodes. Therefore, we should not explore the state-space graph using a queue (first in first out) but a priority queue where we explore the nodes with the shortest distance to our source node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about why this solves our problems. How does changing the order of visiting nodes guarantee that when you reach the destination node you can stop because you found the shortest path?\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note, that we know that there are fast implementations in Python for a priority queue. However, we want to see that you understand how a priority queue works. Therefore you need to use a list, that you update appropriately.***"

    "So far we focussed on the shortest path but often if you use a route planner you are not interested in the shortest path but in the fastest path. So, using faster roads that are a bit longer can give a better solution than using roads with a low speed limit. However, it also depends on the maximum speed of your vehicle, it is useless to take roads with a higher speed limit if you can not take advantage of it. Below, you will implement again a BFS algorithm that incorporates these changes. Note, that a more general fastest path algorithm can actually also give the shortest path with the correct input.\n",

    "## 2.2 Hierarchical Graph Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "***IMPORTANT NOTE: The algorithms in [2.2](#2.2-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations) and [2.3](#2.3a-Solving-the-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations) are more difficult to implement. If you describe and explain in your report how these algorithms should work but you do not implement them thus you skip to [3.0](#3.0-Fastest-Path-Between-Coordinates-(map-level-5)) then you can still get an 8.5. In other words, the following algorithms are designed to see if you can work with the ideas that you have learned in a new way and therefore make the difference between an 8.5 and 10.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some background information. While it is unknown exactly how Google Maps works, there are open-source algorithms that should be similar to what Google Maps does. Often these algorithms include a Hierarchical system, where some nodes are more important than others. This is essentially already what we done when we went from a grid to a graph. Here, we determined that some coordinates were less important than others. However, we could take it one step further, not all nodes are equally important. For example, in a level 5 map, the highway nodes are probably way more important than some nodes inside a neighborhood. Therefore, it does not make a lot of sense to explore every little street to find the fastest route. Just to give you an idea, there are multiple solutions to prevent this behavior such as determining important nodes and connecting those with a cost and path. For example in the image below, only (0,0) and (2,2) are connected with other roads therefore it would make sense to just have a connection from node (0,0) to (2,2) indicate with the red line. Now, we effectively made the graph even smaller and therefore even faster. You can repeat this step multiple times each time removing nodes from the graph making your search faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hierarchical_nodes.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, determining which node should be more important is not easy beyond the coordinate-to-node step and therefore we will use another option which is sectioning off the map into multiple graphs. Each graph is connected to another graph with so-called port nodes and we assume that if you find the fastest path from one node to a port node or between port nodes and connect them you have the fastest path. In [2.3](#2.3a-Solving-the-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations) we will come back to this assumption. A logical way of splitting a level 5 map would be to make a graph for each city and a graph for the highways. Here, the port nodes are the highway exits. This makes the assumptions also more likely to be true as going from a city node to a highway node as fast as possible is probably the fastest path. Why this is the case? In summary, to solve the fastest path we need to solve the following fastest paths going from: coordinate A -> closest node A -> highway exit A -> highway exit B -> closest node B -> coordinate B. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this possible, we need to make a highway graph and we need to make a separate graph for each city. One possibility would be to use our `Graph` class but use the argument `start` such that it works on a country (level 5) map for both the highways and individual cities. In `create_country_graphs`, you need to return the highway graph and a graph for each city.\n",

This would result in a maximum grade of a 9.5, if you describe the idea of this step correctly in your report, but without implementing it.***\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have everything to create the fastest path between two coordinates in different cities. However, there are instances where going from a coordinate A -> closest node A -> highway exit A -> highway exit B -> closest node B -> coordinate B is not the fastest path because the second fastest node A -> highway exit A leads to a much faster highway exit A -> highway exit B time. Therefore, making the found path suboptimal. The current approach where we divide the problem into smaller problems will never guarantee the fastest path unless we solve the hierarchical graph representation where we consider all port nodes. Below, you can find an image of an example where the port nodes are shown. However, to solve this graph we need to know the weight (cost) of each edge which can be found by applying BFS with a priority queue. However, while this would still be a bit faster than just searching from closest node A to closest node B in one go. We still need to find a lot of smaller paths as can be seen in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hierarchical_graph.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, We can explore the graph where we only calculate the fastest path between two connected nodes if it is needed. This can be done by not searching for all highway exits but only the $n$ fastest from both closest nodes at the same time. This solves our previous problem where the second nearest highway exit was the fastest route. Now, we have essentially created a tuning parameter between a fast search and a guaranteed optimal search. Think about what happens if n equals 1 or if n equals the number of highway exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to change three things compared to our previous `BFSSolverFastestPath`:\n",
    " - Our algorithm needs to accept multiple source nodes where each node has a travel time which is the time it takes to get to the source node (this can be zero).\n",
    " - Our algorithm needs to accept multiple destination nodes where each node has a travel time which is the time it takes to get from the destination node to somewhere else (this can be zero).\n",
    " - `find_path` needs to be updated to `find_n_paths`such that it takes into account the destination travel time but also return the $n$ best optimal paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that instead of starting with a history and queue of one node we start with multiple source nodes and we search for multiple destinations. Also, the start cost is not 0, but the cost so far to get there. Similarly, the total path cost for the path includes the cost of the destination node (which can be zero or the cost to get from this destination node to another node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that we already use inheritance to copy-paste all the code from `BFSSolverFastestPath` to `BFSSolverMultipleFastestPaths`. Also, `found_destinations` are now the destinations found by the algorithm, and `destination_nodes` is the input argument containing all destinations. This is different compared to `destinations` as it also contains the travel time for each destination. We gave you the three methods which we think should be adjusted. However, you are free to overwrite any other previous methods as well.\n",

    "The final exercise in this assignment is to combine the algorithms implemented so far to make a path from one coordinate to another where we go from a coordinate A -> closest node A -> highway exit A -> highway exit B -> closest node B -> coordinate B. In this exercise, you should not implement any new path-finding algorithms. Below you can find some hints and rules:\n",
    "- The algorithm you need to write has to work only on level 5 maps.\n",
    "- You only need to find the fastest path, ***not*** the shortest path.\n",
    "- You do not have to find the path in the order given above. For example, you can first find the path from coordinate A to closest node A and the path from coordinate B to closest node B before finding a path between highway exits.\n",
    "- Start with finding in which city each coordinate is.\n",
    "- You are allowed to use helper functions. For example, a function to calculate the time it takes to travel between two nodes.\n",
    "- When searching for the nearest exits assume that all exits are equally good.\n",
    "- If two nodes are in the same city, you need to check if using the highway is faster. This means, however, that you do not have to use them.\n",
    "- If you did [2.2](#2.2-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations), you need to use the different graphs. **You are never allowed to use a BFS solver on the whole map**, not even as a side/sub-step.\n",
    "- As explained in [2.3a](#2.3a-Solving-the-Hierarchical-Graph-Representations), just using one outcome of the previous path-finding algorithm can easily lead to a sub-optimal path. Therefore, to get to all points, you need to use the top $n$ (if possible) best path destinations from the previous algorithm as start destinations in the next path-finding algorithm.\n",

    "During this assignment, we copied all your code to the following **.py** file **\"assignment2_{group}_notebook.py\"**. You also tested your code along the way. However, it is possible that there are still a few errors. Therefore, it is good to run some unittest when you complete all coding. This gives you an extra chance to spot mistakes. Here, we added some unittest for you to use. Note, that they are not ***complete*** and that they are merely an indication if you are above or below a 6 (still no guarantee). In this assignment, there are fewer unittest and the best unittest are checking in the images if your algorithm works. Try, for each algorithm different inputs and check if the route changing how you expect it to change.\n",

    "From this point onwards we strongly advise renaming the **\"assignment2_{group}_notebook.py\"** file to the correct file name that you need to hand in **\"assignment2_{group}.py\"**. Now, you can adjust the **\"assignment2_{group}.py\"** file without the risk of overwriting it when you run the notebook again. This also enables the possibility to run the unittests. Note, that from now on you are done programming in the notebook and you need to adjust the **.py** file to fix bugs. To run the unittests go to the **\"unit_test.py\"** file and run the file in either PyCharm, VSCode, or a terminal. You can run it in a terminal using the following command: `python -m unittest --verbose unit_test.py`. `--verbose` is optional but gives you more details about which tests fail and which succeed.\n",

    " - A small experiment in which you compare (a) the exhaustive approach, as well as (b) the greedy approach, and show over several graphs of increasing size the best-found solution as well as the amount of time needed to come to a solution. You can use the module time (time.time()) to test how long each algorithm takes. However, make sure you do not have any other processes actively running in the background. A better way is using the module timeit for example timeit.repeat(). However, this is a bit more difficult to get working.\n",
